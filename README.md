# PGE_Hackathon_2023
Energy A.I. Hackathon 2023

Goal: Develop a data analytics and machine learning workflow in Python to:

predict/classigy "fail" or "not fail" within 30 days for 40 artificial lift Electronic Submersible Pumps

Background

In order to prevent the production loss caused by Electronic Submersible Pump (ESP) failures in artificial lift operations, we challenge the Energy A.I. Hackathon 2023 teams of The University of Texas at Austin to build a data-driven model to detect when an ESP is within 30 days of failure.

This will require:

- data analysis and evaluation of multiple data sources and a variety of features
- feature engineering including feature selection, feature transformations and feature imputation to address missing data
- integration of domain expertise at every step
- selection, training and tuning robust machine learning prediction models

Your model will be applied to support preventative maintenance by identifying ESPs within 30 days of failure for inspection and repair.
